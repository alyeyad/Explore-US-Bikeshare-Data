# Explore US Bikeshare Data Project

## Overview
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

- You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
- A text editor, like Sublime or Atom. 
- A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).


## Project Description:

A python program that used datasets provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns across three large cities: **Chicago**, **New York City**, and **Washington, DC**.

## Program Features:

1. Prompts the User to Enter the Name of the city.
2. Asks the User to Filter by month, day, both, or none.
3. Calculates Important Statistics, such as:
   1. The Most Frequent Times of Travel
   2. The Most Popular Stations and Trips
   3. Total and Average Travel Times
   4. User Type Counts
4. Displays raw data to the User.
